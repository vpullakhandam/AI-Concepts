    "text=\"There is no question that Farmer Jones is a cruel and neglectful master who tyrannises over the animals on Manor Farm. At the beginning of the novel, Orwell reveals that Jones was “too drunk” to remember to shut the pop holes which allows the animals to congregate and listen to Old Major’s speech. During the speech, Old Major describes how their lives are “miserable, laborious and short.” The animals are forced to work to the “last atom of their strength” and know nothing except “misery and slavery”. It is clear that Farmer Jones is cruel. Old Major describes how the young pigs will “scream their lives out” at the block. The dogs, when they outlive their usefulness, will be drowned in the “nearest pond”. This callous and unfair treatment, however, doesn’t seem to be motivated by malice or selfishness. It is the simple pragmatism of a farmer. Inspired by the centuries of oppression by the Tsarist regime in Russia, Farmer Jones is unquestionably a cruel and heartless master. His tyranny, however, pales in comparison to the cunning, selfishness and manipulation of the pigs. \"\n",
